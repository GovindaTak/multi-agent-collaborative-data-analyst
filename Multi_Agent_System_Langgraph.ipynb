        "#🧩 Project Objective / Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to design and implement a collaborative Multi-Agent System using LangGraph that functions as an intelligent Data Analyst Assistant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional single-agent systems are often limited in their ability to handle multiple tools or cross-domain tasks effectively — even when powered by advanced models like GPT-4o.\n",
        "To overcome this limitation, this project adopts a divide-and-conquer (multi-agent) strategy, where specialized agents are designed for different subtasks and coordinate through a central router.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system will consist of:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Researcher Agent – Responsible for fetching and analyzing live information using web search and retrieval tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Chart Generator Agent – Expert in visualizing data, generating insights through Python-based charts and graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Conditional Routing adges  – Directs user queries to the correct specialized agent based on context and intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach aims to enhance task accuracy, scalability, and efficiency by allowing agents to collaborate intelligently — forming the foundation for next-generation Agentic AI Data Analysis systems."
