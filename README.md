# multi-agent-collaborative-data-analyst
A fully functional multi-user collaborative chatbot system built from scratch using LangGraph, integrating multiple intelligent agents that coordinate to perform data analysis and visualization tasks. The system uses a Research Agent (for live data retrieval) and a Chart Generator Agent (for executing Python code and visualizing results).
